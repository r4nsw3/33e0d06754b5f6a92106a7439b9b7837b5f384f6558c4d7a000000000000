  |   The squid kids called Inklings are back to splat more ink and         |
  |   claim more turf in this colorful and chaotic 4-on-4 action shooter.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the          |
  |   Nintendo Switch system, and use any of the console's portable play    |
  |   styles for intense local multiplayer action.                          |
  |   Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!                |
  |   Two years have passed since the original Splatoon game was            |
  |   released and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a     |
  |   fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear.           |
  |                                                                         |

  |   The previously-announced 4.3.0 update for Splatoon 2 is now live.     |
  |   This is the final content distribution, featuring new weapons and     |
  |   gear abilities.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Fixed an issue causing Octolings not to blink while moving over     |
  |   the ground.                                                           |
  |   - Fixed an issue when taking pictures with the Pearl and Marina       |
  |   amiibo during a Splatfest causing them not to appear in their         |
  |   Splatfest outfits or hair color.                                      |
  |   - Fixed an issue when taking pictures with the Octoling Boy amiibo,   |  
  |    where, depending on the pose, the Octoling Boy's eyes would          |
  |   appear in an unnatural state.                                         |
  |   - Fixed an issue allowing amiibo to be tapped and read while in the   |
  |   lobby during a Splatfest, though the amiibo icon was not displayed    |
  |   on-screen.                                                            |
  |   - Fixed an issue when throwing sub weapons onto a Bounce Pad while    |
  |   in Recon mode, causing them to bounce differently than they would     |
  |   in an actual multiplayer battle.                                      |
  |   - Fixed an issue when using the Auto-Camera to follow the tower in    |
  |   Tower Control, causing the camera angle to differ depending on        |
  |   which team controlled the tower.                                      |
  |   - Fixed an issue in spectator mode when the Auto-Camera was set to    |
  |   ON and viewing the Splat Zone during a Splat Zone battle, causing     |
  |   it not to shift focus to other players.                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Changes to Gear, Multiplayer, Weapons and lots of other changes!      |
